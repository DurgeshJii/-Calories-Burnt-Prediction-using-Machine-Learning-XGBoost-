# Calories-Burnt-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-XGBoost-
# 📊 Project Overview - 
This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning regression model to accurately predict calories burned during exercise using physiological and activity-related features. The complete workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The model is trained using XGBoost Regressor, achieving a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE ≈ 1.48), demonstrating strong predictive performance.
